# Submissions Storage Directory

This directory stores form submissions as JSON files, organized by month (YYYY-MM).

## Structure:
```
submissions/
  2025-12/
    birth-certificate-1703155200000-a7b3c2.json
    driving-license-1703155300000-x8y9z1.json
  2026-01/
    scholarship-1704197400000-e4f5g6.json
```

## MVP Implementation
- Files are created automatically by the `/api/sync-submissions` endpoint
- Each submission is stored as a separate JSON file
- Organized by year-month for easy archival
- Idempotent - duplicate submissions are safely ignored

## Future Migration
When ready, submissions can be migrated to SQLite or PostgreSQL by reading these files and importing them into a database.
